    "### Sliding windows are applied as a training method for the time series, aiming to predict the variable y. Additionally, various ML models such as LGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Linear Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and CatBoost Regressor are trained to obtain the best possible model for the provided data. The model is also optimized using a predefined hyperparameter grid to ensure its robustness in a production environment."
